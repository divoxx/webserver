Server(.go)
===================

For now, this library is just an abstraction for running a webserver for an [Go][go] web application. It provides the following:

* A structure for defining environment specific configurations
* Logging of server behavior
* Simple interface for running an web application
* Handy method for running the the web app accepting parameters from CLI
* Serves static files, which is handy for small apps that won't have Apache or Nginx in front of it or for development
* Logging of requests information

[go]: http://golang.org

Usage Example
=============

Runs a webserver accepting arguments from CLI:

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"
  "webserver"
)

func dispatcher(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // do something with the request, this could dispatch
  // the request to another component, for example.
}

func main() {
  srv := webserver.New(dispatcher)
  webserver.RunCLI(srv)
}
```

Then you can simply run the app:

```bash
./app -l="0.0.0.0:3000"
```
